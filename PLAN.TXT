this text file contains my reasoning and plan to tackle this challenge
this serves as insight to what im thinking, and planning


steps: // should be updated with each and every task to keep track of progress
1 - fork the original repo and clone
2 - explore project structure, code style, organization, test code, get a general feel for the project at hand
3 - fix any possible typescript issues / dependency issues
4 - brainstorm ideas to tackle this challenge

basic plan:
1 - finish functionality. a functional project with no design is better than a well designed project that doesnt achieve its task
2 - when basic functionality is done, design and enhance the style of project for user statisfaction and improving user experience
3 - if time permits, fix layout of project to make the project more understandable to users. (jamil's note: Assume all users a brain dead and require very simple and intuitive UI)
4 - if time permits, create custom components for better reusablity and better maintenance on the long run

Note: Tutoring may affect time commited to project

Note: I edited the data to for more detailed employees allowing for more queries
